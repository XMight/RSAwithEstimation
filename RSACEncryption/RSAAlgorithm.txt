RSA Step-by-step:

Algorithm :
	1.	We choose 2 prime numbers p and q
	2.	We calculate n=p*q 
		(It is recommended that the result of the multiplication of p and q 
		to be in real conditions bigger than 255, to avoid confusion with ASCII characters.
		Here we will use little numbers for explanation, to be human comprehensible the algo)
	3.	We calculate φ(n)=(p-1)(q-1)
	4.	We choose 1<e<φ(n) so that e and φ(n) to not to have common divisors. 
		e will be the exponent of the private key
	5.	We calculate d using the formula : d*e=1(mod φ(n)), and from here d=(1+k*φ(n))/e 
		so that k=2..n; d,k are N (naturals). d must be integral after the division 
	6.	The keys : Public key = Cpub(e, n) ; Private key = Cpriv(d,n)
	7.	Encrypting : C(mes.encr)=pow(m,e) mod n
	8.	Decrypting : m(mes.orig)=pow(C,d) mod n

Exmple :
Message : 12 (ASCII code of a character)
	1.	Let be p=3 and q=5
	2.	N=p*q=15
	3.	φ(n)= (p-1)(q-1)=8
	4.	1<e< φ(n), Let's take for example 7
	5.	A cycle is done with the incrementation of the k from in formula d=(1+k*φ(n))/e 
	from 2 until obtaining d integral number :
	(1+2*8)/7  ≠ not integral
	(1+3*8)/7  ≠ not integral
	[…]
	(1+20*8)/7= integral number
	
	So we obtained d=23 solving the last equation.
	
	6.	Cpub(7, 15), Cpriv.(23,15)
	7.	C(mes.encr)= 127(mod 15) = 35831808 mod 15 = 3
	8.	m(mes.orig)= 323 mod 15 = 94143178827 mod 15 = 12
	
	So we obtained the original message!
